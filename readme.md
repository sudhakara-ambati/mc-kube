# MC Cluster Manager

A high-performance, distributed Minecraft server management platform built for scalability and real-time monitoring.

## Overview

MC Cluster Manager is a comprehensive solution for managing multiple Minecraft servers in a clustered environment. It provides real-time monitoring, automated load balancing, player management, and seamless server orchestration through a modern web interface and robust API.

The platform consists of three main components:
- **Rust-based Web Frontend** - Real-time dashboard with live metrics and server management
- **Java Velocity Plugin** - Proxy server integration for cluster coordination  
- **Spigot Plugin** - Individual server monitoring and management

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring** - Live server metrics, player counts, and performance data
- **Cluster Management** - Add, remove, enable/disable servers dynamically
- **Player Operations** - Transfer players between servers, manage queues
- **Load Balancing** - Automatic traffic distribution across healthy servers
- **Performance Analytics** - Historical data, trends, and performance insights
- **WebSocket Integration** - Live updates without page refreshes
- **REST API** - Complete programmatic access to all functionality
- **Intelligent Caching** - Optimized performance with configurable TTL
- **Plugin Architecture** - Seamless integration with Velocity and Spigot

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+ (for Velocity and Spigot servers)
- Rust (for frontend development)
- Gradle (for plugin builds)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudhakara-ambati/mc-kube.git
   cd mc-kube
   ```

2. **Build the plugins**
   ```bash
   # Build Velocity plugin
   cd java-plugin
   ./gradlew build
   
   # Build Spigot plugin  
   cd ../spigot-plugin
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd rust-backend
   trunk serve
   ```

4. **Configure and start Velocity**
   - Install the built plugin in your Velocity `plugins/` directory
   - Configure API endpoints in plugin config
   - Start Velocity proxy

5. **Install Spigot plugin**
   - Install the built plugin on each Minecraft server
   - Configure connection to Velocity proxy
   - Restart servers

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with the API running on port `8080`.

## API Reference

The REST API provides complete programmatic access to cluster management functionality.

### Health & Monitoring

- `GET /health` — System health check
- `GET /performance/stats` — JVM performance metrics and statistics  
- `POST /performance/cache/clear` — Clear all controller caches

### Server Management

- `GET /server/list` — List all servers with status and player information
- `GET /server/overview` — Dashboard overview with cluster summaries
- `GET /server/{name}` — Detailed information for specific server
- `POST /server/add` — Add new server to cluster
- `POST /server/remove` — Remove server from cluster
- `DELETE /server/remove` — Alternative method to remove server
- `POST /server/enable` — Enable a disabled server
- `POST /server/disable` — Disable an active server

### Metrics & Monitoring

- `GET /metrics/{serverIp}` — Get real-time server metrics
- `POST /metrics/{serverIp}` — Upload server metrics data

### Player Operations

- `POST /transfer` — Transfer players between servers
- `GET /queue/list` — Get list of queued players (UUID/username)
- `GET /queue/count` — Get current queue count
- `POST /queue/remove` — Remove player from queue

### Broadcasting

- `POST /broadcast` — Send message to all players across cluster

### Logging & Audit

- `GET /cluster/logs` — Fetch recent cluster events
- `GET /cluster/logs/stats` — Get log statistics and summaries
- `DELETE /cluster/logs` — Clear all logs (admin only)

## WebSocket Events

Real-time communication between frontend and backend for live updates.

### Server → Client (Broadcasts)

- `server_update` — Server status changes (online/offline/error)
- `player_count_response` — Live player count data
- `server_logs_response` — Streaming log data
- `metrics_update` — Real-time performance metrics
- `alert` — Error and warning notifications

### Client → Server (Requests)

- `get_player_count` — Request current player counts
- `get_server_logs` — Request recent server logs
- `subscribe` — Subscribe to server update notifications
- `execute_command` — Execute command with live output streaming

## Component Details

### Java Plugin Integration

The Velocity and Spigot plugins provide seamless integration with the cluster management system:

- **HTTP REST API** communication between proxy and servers
- **Player Transfer System** for seamless server switching
- **Health Reporting** with automated status updates
- **Real-time Metrics Collection** (TPS, CPU, RAM, player count)
- **Performance Monitoring** with configurable thresholds
- **Load Balancing Coordination** for optimal resource usage

### Frontend Dashboard

Built with Rust and WebAssembly for high performance:

- **Server Grid** — Real-time status overview of all servers
- **Detailed Metrics** — Individual server performance graphs
- **Load Balancer View** — Visual traffic distribution
- **Monitoring Charts** — TPS, CPU, RAM, and player count trends  
- **Alert System** — Real-time notifications for issues
- **Performance Analytics** — Historical data and trend analysis

## Performance & Configuration

### Optimization Features

- **Smart Caching** — TTL-based caching for all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting** — Prevents overload on management operations  
- **Asynchronous Processing** — Non-blocking operations for better responsiveness
- **Thread Pool Management** — Dedicated pools for different operation types
- **Automatic Cleanup** — Cache cleanup every 5 minutes

### Cache Configuration

| Component | TTL | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Server Status | 10s | Overall server health |
| Individual Ping | 5s | Per-server connectivity |
| Queue Data | 2s | Player queue information |
| Metrics | 3s | Performance data |

### Performance Settings

- **Rate Limiting**: 1 second minimum interval between operations
- **Ping Timeout**: 3 second maximum response time
- **Thread Pools**: 8 threads for pings, 4 threads for management

### Expected Performance Gains

- **40-70%** faster API response times
- **50-60%** reduction in network traffic
- **80-90%** fewer database queries
- **20-30%** lower memory usage
- Significantly improved UI responsiveness

## Scaling & Deployment

### Horizontal Scaling

- Deploy multiple Velocity proxy instances behind a load balancer
- Use shared Redis cache for cluster-wide data consistency
- Implement database connection pooling for high concurrency

### Production Recommendations

- **Database**: Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production workloads
- **Caching**: Deploy Redis cluster for distributed caching
- **Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection
- **Networking**: Use internal networks for server-to-server communication

### Security Considerations

- **CORS Policy**: Restricted to authorized frontend domains only
- **Authentication**: Shared secret system for plugin communication  
- **Network Isolation**: Internal communication between cluster components
- **Access Control**: Admin-only endpoints for sensitive operations
